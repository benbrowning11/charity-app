              Prakash Bista was born in Kalikot, a remote village where residents still 
              lack basic medical care. His parents, after a three-day walk to the nearest 
              town, saw children in school uniforms and decided to send Prakash to a 
              boarding school. Tragically, his education was interrupted by a civil war, 
              and his parents passed away in an accident just as he was preparing for his 
              final exams.

              Despite these immense challenges, Prakash founded Impact Schools, convincing 
              neighbours to trust him with building the first school in his village. With 
              scholarships, he studied in the US and at LSE, but unlike many peers who 
              stayed abroad to climb the career ladder, Prakash returned home to expand 
              Impact Schools. Today, these schools educate over 300 children and provide 
              accommodations for more than 30 orphans.
