                    Some of us on the team have experienced suffering in our own lives. We feel 
                    fortunate to enjoy freedoms that many others do not possess, and this sense 
                    of gratitude compels us to give back. Realizing that the problems in our 
                    regions were too vast for us to address directly, we chose to focus on areas 
                    where the core conflicts had subsided but where children still needed help.

                        Inspired by stories of transformation and awe-inspiring beauty in Nepal, 
                        we decided it would be the perfect place to begin our mission. It was 
                        there that we met Prakash Bista, a man whose story exemplifies the power 
                        of education and community.
